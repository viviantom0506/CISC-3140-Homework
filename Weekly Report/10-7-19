Update for 10.7.19

  The product team this week wasn't able to get much done this week due to the lack of ideas that are 
  thrown around. We are having trouble figure out what other features we could implement into the "Mini G*t." 
  We had a really productive week last week and pushed out a lot of designs but this week was slower. By next week we hope we 
  can pick up the momentum again and have a lot more designs released to the front end team. We will overcome this by asking 
  other people in the group what other features they may want to see and ask someone outside of the class project what they
  may want to see in a "Mini G*t."
