  
This week the product team had a few setbacks in terms of coming up with more designs. We pretty much 
finished all the designs for the product and did most of the modifications. We are having problems deciding what
else we can possibly implement into the product and what other modifications we can make. For next week, we hope to 
be able to come up with another change we could make to the product and if not we hope to have another design up
and passing it over to the front end.
